PLDA + Versions
Note: these rely on outdated header files and the majority will no longer compile
They are provided here as a reference only

1.0:	Works without seg faults
	No pthreads
	No OpenMP
	No RMA
	Appears to produce empty topics

1.01:	Moved Ctopic fetch to after every word bundle instead of every iteration to try fix Empty topic
	Didn't work
	Slower than 1.0

1.1:	FIXED EMPTY TOPIC BUG
	Added in Ctopic update step into Cword update

1.2:	Swapped MPI_Ssend for MPI_Send
	Not much improvement if any on hpc13

1.3:	Added option to use matrix over bst for Cword on Pw

1.4:	RMA used
	Only for init topics

1.41:	RMA used
	For init topics and Gibbs sampling

1.42:	Fixed lonsdale RMA issue of creating NULL windows of size 1
	Added command line options to swap Cword method and to swap RMA method

1.43:	Changed to two single windows for RMA init topics
	Works on more than one node

1.44:	Added two window capability to Gibbs Sampling also



2.0:	Added pthreads capability for Gibbs sampling

2.01:	Cleaned up send to any tag functions

2.02: 	Added pthreads capability for Gibbs sampling on Pw side also

2.1:	Added in deadlines and work load balancing to pthreads

2.2:	Used condensed matrix for inverted index too

2.3:	Presorted files by size to try and ease load balance
	Fixed up parse args to reflect this

2.4:	Reattempted pthreads
	Figured out hanging on stopCount getting caught in race condition
	Fixed a few more race conditons
	Code runs MUCH faster on 32 nodes at least
	However still occassionally hangs
	Particularly on b = 12

2.41:	Found that deadlines were skipping everything -> fast code
	Fixed this
	Tried to stop hanging issues
		- No luck yet
	Added Workload balance method

2.5:	Added option to read in normal non-Gutenberg files

2.5.1:	Added in reading from an overall dictionary but a lot slower

2.5.2:	Cleaned up code a bit and checked most frees

2.5.3:	Seperated into header file

2.5.4:	Created pthreads and gibss header seperations
