The Code for "An Analysis of the Parallel Implementations of Latent Dirichlet Allocation in the Field of Digital Humanities"
	Robert Cronin

Main Code for this project can be found in GibbsPLDA+


All Directories
Gibbs-LDA2:		Serial LDA Implementation
Gibbs-LDA-MPI:		AD-LDA Implementation
GibbsPLDA+:		PLDA+ Implementation
tfidf:			TF-IDF Implementation & Read In Functions of a Corpus utilised by LDA implementations also 
testSet:		Creates a test set of documents via random integers
binaryTree:		Binary Tree functions for Cword and Inverted Index part of PLDA+
general:		Various header files for functions used throughout
svd:			Initial serial implementation of SVD



Note: Individual Directories may contain README files with information about compiling and executing code
Note: In most cases running help through the -h flag will provide the most information about the flags

Note: When switching from a Serial to MPI code or vice versa, run make clean first as many header files only use MPI functions when MPI is required
