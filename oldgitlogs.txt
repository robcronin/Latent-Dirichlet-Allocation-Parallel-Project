    Tried pthreads again
    	- Got it working and quite fast -> v2.4
    	- Found it was skipping 90% of computation
    	- Fixed this -> v2.4.1
    		-> quite slow
    		-> still hangs sometimes
    		-> but definitely slower than without
    
    More test data
    	-> created some speed graphs
    
    Saved a draft 1 of report
    Scalasca/Vampir pictures

    Added pthreads capability to Gibbs sampling -> version 2.0
    	- uses 4 threads per MPI process so created new Makefile
    	- one thread for fetch Ctopic, fetch Cword, runGibbs and updateCword
    	- updated printInfo function (and for older files using same function call)
    
    Fixed potential topic sampling issue by adding error check to serial and AD-LDA versions
    Few new timings added to spreadsheet

Author: Robert Cronin <croninro@tcd.ie>
Date:   Thu Aug 17 00:32:30 2017 +0100

    Changed RMA from 2d array of windows to two single windows
    	- One for Cword and one for Ctopic
    	- lonsdale did not like 2d array and crashed for more than 1 node
    	- became v 1.4.4
    
    Finished off the main part of software
    	- few extra code examples
    
    Added a sample output to testing

Date:   Sun Aug 13 22:59:46 2017 +0100

    Used matrix version of Cword to implement RMA reading of Cword values
    	- version 1.4 used RMA to init topics -> 42s -> 36s on make test
    	- version 1.4.1 used RMA for Gibbs sampling -> 45s
    		- hopefully on larger scale will speed up
    	- version 1.4.2 fixed MPI_BOTTOM error on lonsdale's MPI version
    		- also added command line option to switch between RMA of init and of Gibbs
    		- and option to switch between Cword BST and Matrix
    		- Note: doesn't run properly if sbatched on lonsdale for >8 cores
    			- but does for <= 8 or if salloc'd
    Added a Timing ods file to keep track of speed ups
    Updated PLDA and serial to account for new info function
    Increased decimal places of timing to 6

    Added a versions folder to keep track of changes to PLDA+
    Replaced all MPI_Ssend's with MPI_Send's for version 1.2
    Added option to use matrix instead of bst for Cword on Pw -> version 1.3
    	- Gave 1.2x speed up for 100 iterations
    		- Expect bigger multiplier as iterations increases
    Updates to writeup

    	- Works but topics don't appear to be correct
    	- One big topic and then mostly empty otherwise
    	- Not seperated into header files yet either
